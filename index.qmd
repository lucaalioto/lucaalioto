### About Me

Hello! My name is Luca, and I am a 4th-year Political Science and Community Development major at the University of California, Davis. 

My approach to political science lives at the intersection of theory and practice, making me an individual with the hard skills of policy and quantitative human-driven research expertise, created through my soft skills of personal engagement; a qualitative understanding that comes from passion and involvement.

My research interests include democratic backsliding, housing, mass incarceration, media coverage of conflict, transportation, urban economics, and urban planning & policy.

Feel free to contact me at jalioto@ucdavis.edu
