    "section": "Causal Pathways & Theoretical Motivation",
    "text": "Causal Pathways & Theoretical Motivation\nA key to economic voting theory is the idea that voters reward or punish incumbents based on economic performance. A basic understanding is voters reward incumbents for economic good times, punishing it for bad. Conversely, when the economy improves, voters may be less inclined to seek drastic political change and instead opt for continuity (Lewis-Beck & Nadeau, 2010).\nTrump’s 2016 presidential campaign heavily emphasized economic grievances, particularly in regions experiencing economic shocks from globalization such as industrial decline, job loss, and wage stagnation (Colvin, 2016). His populist rhetoric was positioned and positioned as a political outsider as an anti-establishment alternative, promising to restore lost manufacturing jobs, renegotiate trade deals, and challenge political elites. From this signaling and the notion that economic distress fuels populist support, we would expect counties with weaker economic performance to have a stronger shift toward Trump in 2016.\nWhile many counties followed this pattern, economic voting is often filtered through ideological and partisan biases. Perceptions of the economy may not always align with actual economic conditions, as voters tend to interpret economic performance through their existing ideological lens. As an example:\n\nRepublican-leaning voters may be more likely to perceive the economy as performing poorly under a Democratic administration (Obama, 2008–2016), regardless of objective economic indicators.\nDemocratic-leaning voters may be less likely to attribute economic difficulties to systemic issues and globalization, instead focusing on social or policy-based explanations.\n\nThis partisan filtering suggests that ideology moderates both economic perceptions and voting behavior. As a result, in this study, I consider whether economic perceptions mediate the relationship between actual economic conditions and Trump support, and whether ideology moderates the effect of both economic conditions and economic perceptions.\n\nData-Generating Process (DGP)\nThe mechanism linking economic conditions to Trump support can be conceptualized as follows:\n\nEconomic Performance (\\(X\\)) changes between 2012 and 2016 at the county level as the main explanatory variable.\nVoters in these counties form perceptions of the economy (\\(M\\)) as a potential mediator, which may or may not align with actual economic conditions.\nIdeology (\\(Z\\)) as a moderator on both:\n\nHow voters interpret economic conditions\nHow economic perceptions influence Trump support\n\nSupport for Trump (\\(Y\\)) as the outcome, which is ultimately shaped by both objective economic performance and voters’ ideological filters.\nKey controls to block confounding paths:\n\nCollege Graduation Rates: Education is correlated with both economic performance and voting behavior.\nIncome levels: Economic performance is directly tied to income levels, which can influence voting.\nRacial demographics: Racial composition has been shown to influence Trump support, making it an important control.\nPrior GOP support, 2012 election: Controlling for past Republican vote share accounts for historical partisanship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirected Acyclic Graph (DAG)\n\n\n\n\nMathematically, the relationship between the Explanatory and Outcome can be represented as:\n\\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\beta_2 M + \\beta_3 Z + \\beta_4 (X \\times Z) + \\beta_5 (M \\times Z) + \\epsilon\n\\]\nWhere:\n\\(X\\) = Economic conditions (GDP growth) \\(M\\) = Economic perception \\(Z\\) = Ideology \\(Y\\) = Trump vote share\nBased on this framework, I test the following hypotheses:\n\nNull Hypothesis \\[\nH_0: \\text{Economic conditions had no significant effect on Trump’s county-level vote share in 2016.}\n\\]\nEconomic Conditions Hypothesis (Alternative Hypothesis) \\[\nH_1: \\text{Counties with stronger economic growth between 2012 and 2016 were less likely to support Trump in 2016.}\n\\] Economic growth reduces the likelihood of anti-establishment voting, while economic hardship fosters resentment toward the status quo.\nEconomic Perception Mediation Hypothesis \\[\nH_2: \\text{The effect of economic conditions on Trump support is mediated by voters' economic perceptions.}\n\\] If voters’ assessments of the economy reflect actual conditions, this pathway would be expected. Through this hypothesis, economic conditions would effect voters perceptions of the economy which would shift their support for Trump.\nIdeological Moderation Hypothesis \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nH_3: &\\text{ Ideology moderates both the relationship between economic conditions} \\\\\n     &\\text{ and perceptions, and between perceptions and Trump support.}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Partisan bias affects how voters interpret economic information, leading Republican-identifying voters to perceive the economy as worse under a Democratic incumbent, which may increase their likelihood of voting for Trump. Additionally, Ideological acts as a placeholder for other political signaling from media and Trumps framing of social issues (such as immigration and control by political elites)."

    "text": "Sample\n\nUnit of Analysis\nThe unit of analysis for this study is the county-level Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code, which uniquely identifies each county in the United States.\n\n\nData Sources, Coverage, and Aggregation\nTo examine the relationship between economic conditions and Trump’s electoral performance, I integrated multiple datasets covering electoral outcomes, economic performance, public opinion, and demographic characteristics. County-level election data for the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections comes from the MIT Election Lab U.S. Election Data, which provide vote shares for each candidate across 3,156 counties. Economic conditions were measured using county-level GDP data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), capturing yearly economic performance across the same 3,156 counties. To assess economic perceptions, I utilized Gallup Survey Data, which aggregates responses from 12 separate polls conducted between November 6, 2012, and November 8, 2016. Across these four years and 12 survey waves, there were 54,121 respondents, though the number of responses varies by question. Survey responses are coded as dummy or categorical variables.\nWhile the county-level approach provides valuable insights into how local economic conditions influenced Trump’s support, it does not directly capture individual-level voting behavior. Additionally, differences in urban and rural economies may lead to variations in how economic conditions affect political preferences. The Gallup survey data, being aggregated at the county level, reflects broad economic perceptions rather than the sentiments of individual voters. Despite these limitations, the sources allows for an initial analysis of how local economic conditions and public perceptions shaped Trump’s electoral performance in 2016."

This imbalance may pose a challenge when attempting to estimate the causal effect of economic conditions on Trump’s vote share, as counties experiencing economic decline are fewer in number and may differ systematically from those experiencing growth.\nNext, we visualize the relationship between GDP growth and Trump support:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot provides a visual comparison of Trump’s vote share across counties with positive versus negative GDP growth. While the plot shows the expected negative relationship between GDP growth and Trump support,this visualization does not control for potential confounders, making it difficult to infer a causal relationship.\nAdditionally, a key challenge in measuring the causal relationship between GDP growth and Trump support is the non-random distribution of economic growth across counties. To explore this issue, we examine whether counties that experienced GDP growth systematically differ from those that did not along key socioeconomic characteristics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese boxplots illustrate differences in key demographic and economic characteristics across counties with positive versus negative GDP growth. The findings suggest that GDP growth is not randomly assigned across counties, but rather correlated with pre-existing socioeconomic conditions. These relationships can be confirmed with a series of t-tests comparing key variables across GDP groups.\nThese T-tests reveal that counties experiencing GDP growth had significantly higher average incomes(\\(p\\)= 0.003), college graduation rates (\\(p\\) = 0.00001), and White population shares (\\(p\\) = 0.039).Furthermore, economic perceptions differed significantly across GDP groups (\\(p\\)=0.017), suggesting that voters in counties with actual GDP growth were more likely to report that the economy was improving. These results indicate that GDP growth is correlated with key socioeconomic and political factors, raising concerns about potential confounding in our estimates. While controlling for these variables helps mitigate bias, the fundamental issue remains that GDP growth is not an exogenous shock, making it difficult to fully isolate its causal effect on Trump’s support.\n\n\nModel Specification\nTo estimate the relationship between economic conditions and Trump’s support, I use an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model, gradually adding controls and interaction terms.\n\\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\beta_2 M + \\beta_3 Z + \\beta_4 (X \\times Z) + \\beta_5 (M \\times Z) + \\epsilon\n\\]\nModel Progression:\n\nBivariate Model (Baseline): \\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\epsilon\n\\]\nAdding Controls: \\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\sum \\beta_k \\text{Controls} + \\epsilon\n\\]\nTesting for Mediation: \\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\beta_2 M + \\sum \\beta_k \\text{Controls} + \\epsilon\n\\]\nTesting for Moderation:\n\n\\[\n   Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\beta_3 Z + \\beta_4 (X \\times Z) + \\sum \\beta_k \\text{Controls} + \\epsilon\n\\]\n\nFull Model with Interaction Terms:\n\n\\[\n   Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\beta_2 M + \\beta_3 Z + \\beta_4 (X \\times Z) + \\beta_5 (M \\times Z) + \\sum \\beta_k \\text{Controls} + \\epsilon\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(Y\\) = Trump Vote Share\n\\(X\\) = Economic Conditions\n\\(M\\) = Economic Perceptions\n\\(Z\\) = Ideology\n\\(\\sum \\beta_k \\text{Controls}\\) = Set of socioeconomic and political controls - \\(\\epsilon\\) = Error term"

    "section": "Results: The Effect of Economic Conditions on Trump Support",
    "text": "Results: The Effect of Economic Conditions on Trump Support\nThe regression results provide strong evidence that local economic conditions influenced support for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Across all models, counties which saw a Positive Change in GDP were less likely to vote for Trump, supporting the economic conditions hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)). That said the relationship between Change in GDP and Trump Support was significantly moderated by Average Ideology, suggesting that the effect of economic conditions on voting behavior depended on the ideological predispositions of voters. As well, while Positive Perceptions of the Economy correlated with economic conditions, they did not fully mediate the effect, indicating that objective economic conditions played an independent role in shaping voter behavior rather than perceptions in the economy.\n\nModel Estimation\nTo estimate the relationship between economic conditions and support for Trump, I use an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model, gradually adding controls and interaction terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe initial model establishes the effect of Positive Change in GDP on Trump Vote Share without any controls. In this model, the coefficient for Positive Change in GDP is negative and statistically significant, indicating that counties experiencing economic improvement were less likely to support Trump, supporting the Economic Conditions Hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)).\nWhile the magnitude of the effect decreases after introducing the control variables Average Ideology, Percent College Graduates, Average Income, Percent White Population, and Previous GOP Vote Share, the coefficient for Positive Change in GDP remains negative and statistically significant. This suggests that while economic conditions influence Trump support, other demographic and economic factors also play an important role in voter decision-making.\nThe third model tests the Economic Perception Mediation Hypothesis (\\(H_2\\)), examining whether economic perceptions mediate the relationship between economic conditions and Trump support. If economic perceptions were a strong mediator, we would expect the effect size of Positive Change in GDP to substantially decrease or become non-significant when Positive Perceptions of the Economy is added to the model.\nThe results show that while economic perceptions are significantly correlated with economic conditions, they do not fully mediate the effect. The coefficient for Positive Change in GDP remains statistically significant even after controlling for Positive Perceptions of the Economy, indicating that economic improvement reduced Trump support beyond just voters’ subjective economic perceptions. This suggests that other mechanisms, such as economic resentment or partisan framing of economic issues, may also play a role.\nThe final model introduces interaction terms to assess whether Average Ideology moderates the effect of Positive Change in GDP on Trump Vote Share. The results confirm the Ideological Moderation Hypothesis (\\(H_3\\)), showing that the interaction term for Positive Change in GDP and Average Ideology is negative and statistically significant. This indicates that economic growth had a stronger negative effect on Trump support in liberal counties but had a much weaker or near-zero effect in conservative counties. In other words, voters in liberal areas were more likely to shift away from Trump when their local economy improved, whereas conservative voters remained supportive of Trump regardless of economic growth.\nThese results align with the Data-Generating Process (DGP) outlined in our DAG, showing that economic conditions influence Trump support through ideological signaling rather than direct economic perceptions. This suggests that voters’ economic assessments are shaped by partisan identity and ideological framing, rather than by objective economic performance alone. Additionally, these findings reinforce the broader theory that outside of traditionally conservative areas which may be already in support of a Republican candidate, economic conditions significantly impact voter behavior, increasing the appeal of populist candidates in times of economic distress. This highlights how economic discontent fuels anti-establishment sentiment, particularly in politically competitive areas and areas which are not traditionally conservative where economic vulnerability plays a greater role in shaping electoral outcomes.\n\n\nRegression Diagnostics\nTo ensure the robustness of our models and the findings, we ran several diagnostic on our OLS Regressions.\nResidual Analysis: Check for Linearity & Homoscedasticity\nResidual plots were used to check whether residuals were randomly distributed around zero and whether their variance remained constant across fitted values. These diagnostics help evaluate the assumptions of linearity and homoskedasticity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Test stat Pr(&gt;|Test stat|)    \nTukey test   -8.0319          9.6e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nThe residual–fitted plot shows a random scatter of residuals around zero, with no visible curvature or funnel-shaped patterns. This suggests that the linearity assumption is satisfied, indicating that the model appropriately captures the relationship between predictors and Trump’s vote share. As well, it suggests that the residual variance is approximately constant, supporting the assumption of homoskedasticity.\nInfluence Diagnostics: Identify Highly Influential Observations\nAdditionally, influence diagnostics were conducted to identify observations that may have a disproportionate effect on the regression coefficients. Here two plots were used, the first being a leverage plot which identifies counties with unusually large leverage values (those far from the mean of predictor variables) and the seccond being Cook’s Distance Plot which identifies counties that, if removed, would substantially change the regression estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      StudRes        Hat      CookD\n1946 1.516278 0.10950985 0.02824798\n2704 2.939619 0.05987223 0.05474018\n\n\nFrom these tests, we find a small number of counties which had relatively high leverage or Cook’s Distance values, but these did not substantially alter the regression coefficients. After re-estimating the model with these influential points removed, the results remained stable, confirming that the main findings are not driven by outliers.\nModel 5: Removing Influential Observations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Residual analysis confirmed that the linear model specification was mostly appropriate, though minor deviations and outliers existed within the data. The Cook’s Distance analysis identified a small number of high-leverage counties that disproportionately influenced the model. After removing these influential observations and re-estimating the regression, the coefficients remained stable, confirming that the results were not driven by a few outliers.\nVisualizing the Interaction Effects\nAdditionally, the predicted values from Model 4 allow us to visualize the interaction effect between Positive Change in GDP and Average Ideology on Trump Vote Share. The graph plots how the expected Trump vote share changes across different levels of ideology when a county experiences economic growth.\nInteraction Between GDP Growth and Ideology on Trump Support:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization confirms the moderation effect observed in Model 4, with the slope of the predicted vote share indicating that economic growth is associated with a decline in Trump support, but this effect is conditional on ideology. In more liberal counties (higher Average Ideology scores represented by 3.04 on the graph), a Positive Change in GDP leads to a stronger decrease in Trump Vote Share. In conservative counties (lower Average Ideology scores represented by 2.23), a Positive Change in GDP has a much weaker or near-zero effect on Trump support.\nThis suggests that liberal voters were more likely to shift away from Trump in response to economic growth, whereas conservative voters were largely unresponsive to changes in local economic conditions. This interaction highlights how partisan biases filter economic conditions, reinforcing the idea that conservative voters’ support for Trump was less dependent on economic performance, while liberal and moderate voters were more likely to adjust their preferences based on economic growth.\n\n\nBaseline group not specified; choose treat = 0 as the baseline group. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph illustrates the moderation effect of ideology on the relationship between GDP growth (Positive Change in GDP) and Trump support (Trump Vote Share %)\nThe downward-sloping black line represents the interaction effect trend, indicating that as ideology becomes more liberal, the effect of GDP growth on Trump support becomes more negative. This means that in liberal counties, economic growth significantly reduces Trump support, whereas in conservative counties, GDP growth has little to no impact on Trump’s vote share.\nThese results align with the Ideological Moderation Hypothesis (\\(H_3\\)), which posits that partisan identity conditions how voters respond to economic conditions. The findings suggest that conservative voters are largely unaffected by economic improvements, whereas liberals and moderates are more likely to shift away from Trump when economic conditions improve. This supports the argument that economic voting is asymmetric, with economic performance shaping electoral outcomes primarily among non-conservative voters, while conservatives remain largely committed to their political preferences regardless of economic conditions."

    "title": "Economic Conditions and Populist Support: County-Level Evidence from the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election",
    "section": "Next Steps",
    "text": "Next Steps\nThis study provides a foundation for understanding how economic conditions shaped support for Donald Trump in the 2016 election, but there are several approaches that could be taken to expand on these findings.\nOne key direction would be to examine how views on immigration and gender biases interact with economic conditions to influence Trump support. Given that Trump’s campaign rhetoric heavily emphasized immigration restrictions and anti-establishment populism, voter perceptions of immigration may serve as a stronger predictor of support than economic conditions alone. This may be especially true in counties which saw significant economic decline, such as manufacturing hubs and highly industrial areas, as a result of globalization which may be more likely to direct their dissatisfaction toward immigrants. As well, given the role of gender dynamics in U.S. elections, exploring attitudes toward women in leadership could help explain whether gender biases played a role in voter preferences.\nAnother interesting expansion of this project would be to apply similar methodology to the 2024 U.S. presidential election, a period characterized by greater economic shock and a more extreme Trump platform centered on democratic backsliding and institutional dismantlement. Studying how economic conditions influenced support for Trump in 2024—in a context of heightened political polarization, inflationary pressures, and global economic instability, may offer insight into whether economic grievances remain a key driver of Trump’s appeal or whether institutional concerns and political identity have overtaken economic factors in shaping voter behavior. Additionally, as Trump appealed to the success of his previous economy, examining the perceptions of the economy during Trumps first presidency as well as the actual economic change could provide insight into how voters interpreted his economic performance.\nAdditionally, while this paper poses a causal question, the methodology employed identifies only associations between the independent and dependent variables rather than a true causal relationship. The current research design presented in this paper cannot fully disentangle which mediating mechanisms matter most, nor can it block all potential backdoor paths between economic conditions and electoral outcomes.\nFuture iterations of this project could strengthen causal inference by adopting quasi-experimental or instrumental variable (IV) approaches. As an example, studies such as “Importing Political Polarization? The Electoral Consequences of Rising Trade Exposure” (Autor, Dorn, Hanson, & Majlesi) use exogenous shocks to local labor markets—specifically, trade exposure to Chinese imports—as an instrument for economic distress. A similar research design could be applied here by identifying exogenous sources of variation in local economic performance, such as manufacturing plant closures, trade exposure indices, or resource shocks. Using this methodology would help isolate the causal effect of local economic change on political preferences and clarify the mechanisms linking economic hardship to populist support.\nBy incorporating these extensions, future studies could provide a more comprehensive picture of the economic, social, and ideological factors that drive populist support in the U.S. and offer a comparative lens on how economic and institutional concerns evolved between 2016 and 2024."

Amnesty reports that many of these deaths occurred in direct or deliberately indiscriminate attacks, often annihilating entire multigenerational families. Israel’s bombardment also caused what experts describe as “unprecedented destruction,” leveling entire cities, destroying agricultural land, religious and cultural sites, and rendering much of Gaza uninhabitable.

    "text": "Hypothesies and Motivations\nThis project investigates how major U.S. newspapers framed the Israel–Hamas conflict in the immediate aftermath of the October 7, 2023 attacks by analyzing the reader’s initial impression — the headline. I hypothesize that the language used to describe Israeli and Palestinian actors in the headlines of US news media diverges systematically along dimensions of sentiment and framing—particularly in the attribution of aggression, victimhood, and legitimacy. The aim is to measure differences in tone, emotional framing, and lexical patterns across the headlines which referencing Israeli and Palestinian actors, and in doing so, to evaluate whether coverage aligns with or departs from the humanitarian realities reported by organizations such as Amnesty International.\nThrough this analysis, I seek to quantify whether and how U.S. newspapers exhibit differential portrayals of the two sides. Specifically, I focus on whether Israeli and Palestinian actors are presented with distinct emotional tones, topic emphases, and narrative frames in mainstream media coverage between October 7 and December 31, 2023. By isolating and comparing these textual signals, the study aims to uncover asymmetries in representation that may suggest underlying media bias.\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{l}\nH_0\\text{: There is no systematic difference in the language used to describe Israeli and Palestinian actors} \\\\\n\\text{in U.S. newspaper coverage of the Israel–Hanas conflict} \\\\\n\\\\\nH_1\\text{: There is a systematic difference in the language used to describe Israeli and Palestinian actors} \\\\\n\\text{in U.S. newspaper coverage of the Israel–Hamas conflict}\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nThe latent variable of interest is media framing bias, which I define here as the implicit patterns in journalistic language that portray one group as more legitimate, victimized, aggressive, or responsible than the other. While existing literature suggests that the absence of linguistic asymmetry in coverage of the Israel–Palestine conflict can obscure the effect of the disproportionate death toll and destruction inflicted by the Israeli military, this paper does not evaluate omissions or false equivalencies. Instead, it focuses solely on assessing the language that is present in mainstream coverage during the period of analysis."

In the ProQuest database, I searched for articles containing references to the conflict using a Boolean query that captured both geographic and conflict-related keywords. The following search was used to retrieve relevant articles from the ProQuest U.S. Major Dailies database:\n(“Israel” OR “Palestine” OR “Gaza” OR “Hamas” OR “West Bank” OR “Israel-Hamas” OR “Israel-Gaza”) AND (“war” OR “conflict” OR “attack” OR “bombing” OR “ceasefire” OR “hostage” OR “invasion” OR “crisis” OR “aid”) AND LA(english)\nFrom this I created a corpus with an n of 10,861 articles that were published in the U.S. Major Dailies collection during the specified time period. The search was designed to capture a wide range of articles related to the Israel–Palestine conflict, restricted to articles in English and to the following newspapers: The New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Wall Street Journal, Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, San Francisco Chronicle, among others included in the U.S. Major Dailies collection. I further filtered the results to include only relevant article types, including only news reports, editorials, commentaries, and features, while excluding obituaries, multimedia clips, and corrections. The resulting dataset represents a curated collection of mainstream media coverage of the Israel–Palestine conflict during the defined time period.\nUnfortunately, due to most newspapers’ terms and conditions on data scraping, the original source data cannot be shared from ProQuest TDM Studio."

    "section": "Methodology",
    "text": "Methodology\nOnce collected, the articles were pre-processed in R using the quanteda package. The unit of analysis was the paragraph, which allowed for finer-grained comparisons of framing within individual documents. After constructing a corpus, I applied a series of standard pre-processing steps summarized by the acronym P-N-L-W-S-C:\n\nP – Removed punctuation and symbols to clean the text and reduce noise.\nN – Removed numbers to eliminate irrelevant numerical tokens.\nL – Applied normalization by converting all words to lowercase.\nW – Removed stopwords, including both standard English stopwords and a custom list (e.g., “Mr.,” “said,” and outlet names like New York Times) to eliminate high-frequency but semantically weak terms.\nS – Applied stemming to unify word forms (e.g., “Israeli,” “Israelis” → “israel”).\nC – Identified and compounded multi-word expressions (collocations) to treat them as single units (e.g., ‘Gaza Strip’ -&gt; ‘gaza_strip’)\n\nBefore tokenization and stemming, I included key abbreviations and dates that commonly occur within the data Terms like ‘U.S.’ were standardized to ‘US’, ‘U.N.’ to ‘UN’, and ‘Oct. 7’ to ‘oct7’ through a targeted substitution process. This ensured these critical entities were treated as single, coherent units throughout the analysis.\nI then created a document-feature matrix (DFM), built from the stemmed and compounded tokens, ensuring that all features (words and collocations) were in their standardized, processed form before further grouping. I then applied the Lexicoder Sentiment Dictionary (LSD2015) to the DFM for downstream analysis.\nFor identifying mentions of Israeli or Palestinian actors, I used a distinct pre-processing approach to create binary flags (has_israeli and has_palestinian). Rather than creating separate corpora for each group, I flagged each paragraph in the main DFM. These flags were generated by searching the stemmed versions of the initial tokens for specific identifiers. This process allowed for improved matching across different word forms.\n\nFor Israeli references, the list of identifiers included: “Israel,” “Israeli,” “Jewish,” “Tel Aviv,” “Jerusalem,” “Netanyahu,” and “oct7.”\nFor Palestinian references, the list included: “Palestine,” “Arab,” “Palestinian,” “Palestinians,” “Gaza,” “Gaza Strip,” and “Rafah.”\n\nEach paragraph was labeled as has_israeli, has_palestinian, or both, depending on the presence of these identifiers. This tagging structure enabled comparative analysis without fragmenting the corpus.\nI then conducted a multi-step textual analysis. First, I calculated TF-IDF scores separately for Israeli- and Palestinian-flagged paragraphs to uncover distinctive lexical patterns. Second, I performed sentiment analysis using LSD2015 to compare emotional tone between the two sets of paragraphs. Third, I applied both unsupervised and seeded Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models to identify recurring themes and frames. The seeded LDA model used a custom dictionary of terms representing common narratives, including frames of victimization, terrorism, occupation, and resistance, to better understand how each group was portrayed.\nFinally, I constructed a smaller dictionary categorizing headline terms as Israeli-related, Palestinian-related, or neutral. I counted the frequency of these tags in headlines and compared the distribution to my own bias coding, using the proportion of conflict terms present in each category. This comparison enabled a rough check of how headline framing aligned with broader sentiment and topic patterns in the full-text articles."

    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\n\nWord Frequencies by Group\nTo explore differences in how Israeli and Palestinian actors are framed, I analyzed the most frequent terms in headlines tagged as referencing each group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure above shows the top 15 terms in each subset. While many of the terms among the two groups are similar, their frequency and context among the other terms differ.\nIn headlines referencing Israeli actors, the most prominent terms include “israel,” “isra,” “netanyahu,” and “jewish.” These terms suggests a framing that contextualizes the mention of Isreal by its national identity, political leadership, and religious character rather than the conflict or its US relations. As well, terms such as “gaza,” “war,” and “attack” having similar frequencies to “oct7” indicate that coverage is heavily framed in the events of October 7, 2023. This centering of Israeli hardship creates a narratives centered around Israel’s response to violence, rather than its disproportionate enactment of it. Other terms such as “hezbollah,” “biden” and “us” further points to a broader geopolitical framing that positions Israel as an actor in a regional security context.\nWhile the first mention of any Palestinian actor within Israeli-tagged headlines does not appear until the 7th and 8th most frequent terms, with “hama” and “gaza,” in Palestinian-tagged headlines, the terms “rafah” and “israel” emerge as the most frequent after basic identifiers. While “rafah” may be in reference to the humanitarian crisis which occured in the region, its high frequency in contrast with terms such as “aid” and “world” more likely reflects the political tensions that between the Biden administration and Prime Minister Netanyahu over Israeli military actions in southern Gaza than the crisis itself.\nThis centering of Israeli and U.S. politics within Palestinian-tagged content suggests that Palestinians are often framed in relation to external state powers, rather than as autonomous political actors. Additionally, terms such as “aid,” “west_bank,” and “arab” emphasize a humanitarian and geographic lens, rather than one focused on leadership, institutional authority, or national sovereignty. This contrast reinforces a broader asymmetry in media framing, where Israeli actors are presented with a clear state identity, while Palestinian actors are often represented through crisis, dependency, or relation to foreign governments.\n\n\nTF-IDF\nTo further explore the differences in sentiment between the two groups, I calculated TF-IDF scores for each group and visualized the top terms. As opposed to the basic term-frequency analysis, TF-IDF scores works to identify terms that are particularly distinctive to each group, rather than just the most frequent terms across both groups — helping to highlight any unique language used in headliens referencing Israeli and Palestinian actors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure above presents the top 15 TF-IDF terms for each group, which reflects many of the same patterns as the word frequencies For Israeli-tagged headlines, prominent terms include “netanyahu,” “oct7,” “attack,” “hezbollah,” and “strike,” reflecting a framing centered on leadership, military action, and Israel’s role as a primary actor in the conflict. Notably, “hamas” is the only Palestinian actor to appear in the Israeli TF-IDF list, and it does so relatively low in the ranking—indicating that Palestinian actors are rarely discussed in detail within headlines focused on Israel. In contrast, Israeli terms dominate the Palestinian TF-IDF list: “israel” appears near the top, alongside “us” and “biden”, reinforcing the observation that Palestinian actors are often framed through the lens of external powers.\nThe Palestinian TF-IDF terms include words such as “gaza,” “rafah,” “aid,” “food,” “un,” and “egypt.” These reflect a humanitarian framing, where Palestinian experiences are depicted primarily in relation to crisis, displacement, and dependency. There is no mention of Palestinian leadership or political figures apart from “hamas,” suggesting a lack of narrative space for Palestinian agency or governance. The presence of “egypt” likely reflects Egypt’s geopolitical role in facilitating aid through the Rafah crossing, again positioning Palestinians as passive subjects in the actions of others.\nAdditionally Israeli TF-IDF set also includes terms regarding conflict such as “plan,” “strike,” and “attack,” which stands in direct contrast to the Palestinian terms which only includes the word “war.” While their prevalence may be due to a presentation of Israel as the aggressor, these terms occur far less than terms such as “oct 7” and “hamas,” words used to frame the conflict through the lens of retaliation. As a result, it suggests that violence occurring on both side is being filtered through the presentation of Israel as a justified victim within the conflict. As well, the contrast creates a framing of Israeli actors as strategic and active agents in the region, while Palestinian actors are framed primarily as subjects of violence or humanitarian crises.\n\n\nSentiment Analysis\nIn hopes of capturing the emotional tone of the headlines and the sentiment expressed towards Israeli and Palestinian actors, I applied sentiment analysis using the Lexicoder Sentiment Dictionary (LSD2015). This dictionary provides a set of positive and negative words that can be used to quantify sentiment in text. The sentiment scores were calculated for each headline in the DFM, and then aggregated to compare the average sentiment towards Israeli and Palestinian actors. Additionally, alongside the flag for either Israeli or Palestinian actors I created a binary flag for whether a headline mentioned both Israeli or Palestinian actors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in figure, the results reveal relatively small differences in average sentiment across groups. Headlines that reference both Israeli and Palestinian actors show slightly higher negative sentiment and lower net sentiment than those referencing only one side. However, overall variation is minimal.\nWhile this finding may suggest some level of parity in emotional tone across the corpus, it also raises questions about the sensitivity of dictionary-based sentiment tools to the specific framing strategies used in conflict reporting. Words associated with violence (e.g., “airstrike,” “hostage,” “siege,” “retaliation”) may not be classified as inherently positive or negative in the dictionary but carry heavy connotative weight in the context of war. As such, future research should consider developing or supplementing existing sentiment dictionaries with custom lexicons tailored to conflict, war reporting, and humanitarian discourse. This would better capture the nuances of how language signals blame, legitimacy, or victimhood in journalistic framing.\n\n\nUnsupervised Machine Learning (LDA Model) Results\nTo provide a broader view of the thematic content in the headlines, I applied an unsupervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to identify recurring topics and patterns. LDA is a model that assumes each headline can be represented as a mixture of different topics, and each topic is defined as a distribution of words that frequently appear together. The topics are generated by clustering words that tend to co-occur across the corpus, finding patterns of which words occur togrther across the headlines in the corpus.\nBecause this stage of the analysis was primarily exploratory and intended to guide the later supervised model, I chose to group the terms into an arbitrary ten topics.\n\n\n      Topic 1   Topic 2     Topic 3      Topic 4     Topic 5       Topic 6 \n [1,] \"trump\"   \"leader\"    \"israel\"     \"attack\"    \"israel\"      \"us\"    \n [2,] \"us_news\" \"face\"      \"say\"        \"strike\"    \"palestinian\" \"war\"   \n [3,] \"hous\"    \"presid\"    \"un\"         \"border\"    \"gaza\"        \"israel\"\n [4,] \"gop\"     \"antisemit\" \"us\"         \"hezbollah\" \"aid\"         \"iran\"  \n [5,] \"vote\"    \"elect\"     \"peac\"       \"iran\"      \"west_bank\"   \"talk\"  \n [6,] \"end\"     \"nation\"    \"critic\"     \"lebanon\"   \"fear\"        \"take\"  \n [7,] \"school\"  \"china\"     \"want\"       \"offici\"    \"world\"       \"shift\" \n [8,] \"speaker\" \"back\"      \"washington\" \"kill\"      \"hospit\"      \"get\"   \n [9,] \"senat\"   \"colleg\"    \"group\"      \"conflict\"  \"civilian\"    \"home\"  \n[10,] \"parti\"   \"now\"       \"blinken\"    \"target\"    \"isra\"        \"use\"   \n      Topic 7     Topic 8     Topic 9   Topic 10    \n [1,] \"biden\"     \"hama\"      \"protest\" \"gaza\"      \n [2,] \"democrat\"  \"world-wid\" \"state\"   \"isra\"      \n [3,] \"netanyahu\" \"plan\"      \"campus\"  \"world_news\"\n [4,] \"ukrain\"    \"fight\"     \"amid\"    \"war\"       \n [5,] \"polit\"     \"israel\"    \"student\" \"us\"        \n [6,] \"deal\"      \"show\"      \"univers\" \"first\"     \n [7,] \"alli\"      \"harri\"     \"tension\" \"forc\"      \n [8,] \"campaign\"  \"american\"  \"test\"    \"death\"     \n [9,] \"make\"      \"call\"      \"polic\"   \"militari\"  \n[10,] \"call\"      \"hostag\"    \"jewish\"  \"year\"      \n\n\nFrom the unsupervised LDA model, I identified several coherent topics many of which centered around the United States and its domestic politics or foreign policy. As an example, Topics 1, 3, 6, and 7 included terms that pointed toward American political debates and policy responses. Similarly, Topics 2 and 9 were dominated by terms related to student protests within the United States.\nOnly two of the ten topics focused directly on the Israel–Hamas conflict without a strong U.S. framing. Topic 4 captured Israel’s external conflicts and regional military engagements, with words such as “Lebanon,” “Hezbollah,” “kill,” and “target.” Topic 5 highlighted humanitarian concerns, with terms like “aid,” “world,” and “civilian,” but without strong emphasis on the violence or death toll itself.\nTaken together, these findings suggest a consistent framing pattern to previous findings, with the non-Isreali actors in conflicts involving Israel are often described through the language of violence and military action, whereas references to Gaza when mentioned alongside Isreal leaned toward humanitarian narratives. This distinction echoes trends observed in the earlier descriptive analyses, reinforcing the idea that media coverage presents Israeli actions as militarily aggressive while framing Gaza primarily through humanitarian crisis.\n\n\nSupervised Machine Learning Model Results\nTo assess how headlines frame the Israel–Hamas conflict more specifically, I used a seeded LDA model. Unlike the fully unsupervised model, which groups the terms without any input, seeded LDA uses theory-driven “seed” word lists to guide topic toward predefined framing categories. The model still learns from the full corpus, taking the given seeded list and pulling in additional words that frequently co-occur with the given terms.\nFraming categories:\n\nVictimization: language emphasizing harm and suffering (victims, massacres, injuries, civilians, children, hospitals, displacement).\nAggression: language emphasizing offensive or kinetic action (attacks, invasions, terrorists, bombs, raids, airstrikes, assaults, rockets).\nResistance: language emphasizing opposition and struggle (resistance, uprisings, liberation, intifada, freedom fighters).\nTerrorism: language labeling actors or acts as extremist or jihadist (terrorism, militants, extremists, jihadists).\nLegitimacy/Illegitimacy: language about sovereignty, legality, and territorial claims (occupation, illegality, settlements, sovereignty, international law).\nDiplomacy/De-escalation: language about conflict resolution (ceasefire, peace, negotiations, diplomacy, truces, mediation).\nHumanitarian: language about relief and civilian well-being (aid, refugees, blockades, sieges, famine, ambulances, evacuations).\n\nFor each headline, the model estimates a probability distribution over these frames, giving each headline a percentage for each given category. I interpret results along two dimensions, the first being examining vocabulary expansion and the seccond prevelance of each topic. For vocabulary expansion, I examine the top learned terms per topic show how the press actually instantiates each frame in the corpus. For prevalence I show the share of headlines (or average per-headline probability mass) associated with each frame overall and within the flagged categories of Israeli or Palestinian indicators.\n\n\n      victimization aggression   resistance  terrorism    legitimacy  \n [1,] \"gaza\"        \"attack\"     \"protest\"   \"world-wid\"  \"us\"        \n [2,] \"hama\"        \"israel\"     \"state\"     \"israel\"     \"israel\"    \n [3,] \"isra\"        \"iran\"       \"antisemit\" \"war\"        \"netanyahu\" \n [4,] \"palestinian\" \"us\"         \"campus\"    \"now\"        \"plan\"      \n [5,] \"civilian\"    \"hama\"       \"student\"   \"american\"   \"biden\"     \n [6,] \"hostag\"      \"bomb\"       \"call\"      \"polit\"      \"world_news\"\n [7,] \"israel\"      \"strike\"     \"school\"    \"america\"    \"ukrain\"    \n [8,] \"gazan\"       \"raid\"       \"leader\"    \"make\"       \"deal\"      \n [9,] \"fear\"        \"hezbollah\"  \"univers\"   \"turn\"       \"cease-fir\" \n[10,] \"west_bank\"   \"lebanon\"    \"colleg\"    \"middl_east\" \"talk\"      \n[11,] \"world\"       \"assault\"    \"jewish\"    \"year\"       \"border\"    \n[12,] \"famili\"      \"world_news\" \"polic\"     \"need\"       \"meet\"      \n[13,] \"hospit\"      \"kill\"       \"us_news\"   \"chang\"      \"effort\"    \n[14,] \"world_news\"  \"forc\"       \"chicago\"   \"review\"     \"isra\"      \n[15,] \"return\"      \"iranian\"    \"harvard\"   \"want\"       \"blinken\"   \n      diplomacy    humanitarian\n [1,] \"biden\"      \"aid\"       \n [2,] \"trump\"      \"war\"       \n [3,] \"democrat\"   \"news_brief\"\n [4,] \"harri\"      \"us\"        \n [5,] \"elect\"      \"amid\"      \n [6,] \"hous\"       \"global\"    \n [7,] \"gop\"        \"rise\"      \n [8,] \"vote\"       \"say\"       \n [9,] \"republican\" \"risk\"      \n[10,] \"campaign\"   \"biden\"     \n[11,] \"presid\"     \"busi\"      \n[12,] \"senat\"      \"use\"       \n[13,] \"speaker\"    \"stop\"      \n[14,] \"truce\"      \"grow\"      \n[15,] \"voter\"      \"china\"     \n\n\nThese expansions suggest that the media frames Israeli-referencing headlines more often through Aggression and Legitimacy, emphasizing military action and state authority. That said, its inclusion in aggression is alongside actors other than Hamas, reinforcing the pattern that aggression and violence is being covered in the countries affairs outside of Gaza. Additionally, it showed that categories which might be assumed to be used in the context of resistance in Gaza or the role Hamas plays in being a terrorist organization gets downed out by American centered headlines, such as the student movement for resistance and a broader middle-eastern framing for terrorism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo explore the prevalence across groups, I graphed the average framing probabilities by term of headlines. Headlines flagged only Palestinians as well as both Israelis and Palestinians scored highest on the Victimization frame, consistent with an emphasis on civilian harm and humanitarian suffering. This also supports the idea that Palestinian harm and suffering is qualified by Israeli harm (specifically with the events on October 7th).\nAside from the large spikes in legitimacy, the majority of the averages had only small differences. Headlines mentioning only Israelis were more likely to be framed through Aggression and Legitimacy, highlighting military action and questions of state authority. Headlines mentioning neither actor explicitly were comparatively more likely to emphasize Diplomacy and Resistance, suggesting these narratives were often decoupled from direct references to either Israel or Palestinians, likley due to an American focus.\nTogether, these distributions reinforce the broader trend seen throughout the paper, with Israel being framed more often through aggression and legitimacy, while Gaza/Palestinians are framed more often through victimization and humanitarian crisis. The “both” group sits in between, whereas “neither” headlines shift toward political process and protest language.\n\n\nBag of Words:\nTo expand on the analysis validate the framing patterns, I developed a manual coding scheme and conducted a human-coding alongisde a bag-of-words grouping. A list of terms was compiled for each bias category, and word frequencies were examined across the corpus to flag potentially biased headlines. From these flagged headlines, I selected a subset for manual classification by two independent coders. The goal was to assess whether human judgments aligned with the computational model and to evaluate the clarity of the coding scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe flagged term analysis reveals a clear imbalance in how bias-indicative language appears across headlines. As shown above, terms associated with the Neutral/Conflict category dominate the corpus, appearing 1,173 times, far greater either sided terms. By contrast, Pro-Israel terms appeared 387 times, while Pro-Palestine terms appeared only 216 times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can further be seen with the breakdown of the top terms within each group, with Pro-Palestinain terms such as genocide or dicplacement being far lower in count than October 7th or Terror. As well, these Pro-Palestinan terms of violence which depict the disprotportionate death toll during the conflict are significantly less common than neutral terms such such as war, fight, and conflict.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure above shows a asymmetry in the frequency of bias-indicative terms between the two groups. Headlines flagged with Israeli references contained a much larger share of Pro-Israel terms than Pro-Palestine terms, indicating a bias toward Israeli perspectives when the actor is named explicitly. In contrast, headlines flagged with Palestinian references did not exhibit a similar skew toward Pro-Palestine terms. Instead, these headlines relied more heavily on Neutral conflict language or humanitarian descriptors, underscoring the earlier finding that Palestinian actors are less often framed through partisan terms and more often through generalized or humanitarianized language.\n\n\nIntercoder Reliability:\nTo confirm the reliability of the bag-of-words approach, I conducted a human-coding exercise. The initial dictionary method flagged headlines as potentially biased based on the frequency of Pro-Israel, Pro-Palestine, or Neutral terms. To evaluate the validity of these automated flags, two independent human coders reviewed a random subset of the flagged headlines. The following was used as a codebook for the human coders.\nCategory 1: Pro-Israel\n\nDefinition: Headlines legitimize Israeli actions, emphasize Israeli security or victimhood, or portray Palestinians negatively.\nKey Cues: The use of the passive voice, “self-defense,” “retaliation,” “security,” “terrorism/terrorist,” “Hamas,” “hostages,” “massacre.”\nExamples: Israel, Israeli, Jewish, Netanyahu, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Oct. 7.\n\nCategory 2: Pro-Palestine\n\nDefinition: Headlines highlight Palestinian suffering, criticize Israeli actions, or frame Palestinian resistance as an appropriate response to agression.\nKey Cues: “occupation,” “settlement,” “blockade,” “siege,” “humanitarian crisis,” “refugee,” “genocide,” “apartheid.”\nExamples: Palestine, Palestinian, Gaza, Rafah, West Bank, resistance, humanitarian.\n\nCategory 3: Neutral\n\nDefinition: Headlines report events factually or in balanced terms without clear bias.\nKey Cues: “conflict,” “war,” “clash,” “casualties,” “diplomacy,” “ceasefire,” “UN,” “US.”\nExamples: conflict, fighting, injured, crisis, solution.\n\nDecision Rules (for ambiguous cases):\n\nCode by the dominant frame if one side is emphasized.\nIf no strong bias is present → Neutral.\nIf framing is balanced/mixed → Neutral.\nIf no relevant terms appear → Neutral.\n\nCoding Results\nUsing the condensed codebook, two independent coders classified a subset of flagged headlines. The intercoder reliability scores indicate a high level of consistency:\n\nAverage pairwise agreement: 83.3%\nKrippendorff’s alpha: 0.746\nAverage pairwise Cohen’s kappa: 0.75\n\nAll three measures score above the 0.70 threshold needed to be confident in the coder reliability, further reinforcing the methods used to analyze the corpus as a whole.\n\n\nConclusion\nOverall, the analyses did not provide sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. While many of the results revealed small differences in framing, these differences were not consistently large enough to reach conventional levels of statistical significance. However, several of the observed patterns remain theoretically meaningful and warrant further exploration. Future work should test the statistical robustness of these differences, ideally with larger samples and extended time frames, to assess whether the trends identified here hold under more rigorous conditions."
